# Jargonify Site

This is my personal porfolio.

### Feature Creep

- Flesh out this TODO

Immediate:
- Inline related articles
- Estimated read time
- Last edited (?)
- Scroll to top
- SVGs
    - Background Error
    - Icons (contents)
- Fix videos inline
- Background, try a little gradient going down, and maybe add a tiny bit of film noise

Future:
- PWA
- Add photos page
- Properly commented TS
- Properly unit tested TS
- Properly commented SCSS
- Make names of some things global settings (like 'alternative features')

- Get matching business cards
