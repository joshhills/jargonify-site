# Jargonify Site

This is my personal porfolio.

### Feature Creep

- RecommendationPost - dashed outline, used to point to useful external sources.
- Analytics
- Survey monkey
- Lazy loading of assets (gaussian etc., colour average)
- Add a 'number found' to search
- Change blurb page to 'about' page
- Properly commented TS
- Properly unit tested TS
- Properly commented SCSS
- Change underline on pagination to a border?
- Use cookies to remember what is happening...
- Make names of some things global settings (like 'alternative features')

- Add the 'client experience' to site eventually - like what clients should expect workflow wise
