# Jargonify Site

This is my personal porfolio.

### Feature Creep

- Flesh out this TODO

Immediate:
- Make a PWA
    - Add a context-aware install link
    - Add notifications (?)
- SVGs
    - Icons (contents)
- Add photos page

- Background, try a little gradient going down, and maybe add a tiny bit of film noise

Future:
- Properly commented TS
- Placeholder when loading
- Properly unit tested TS
- Properly commented SCSS
- Make names of some things global settings (like 'alternative features')
- Animations

- Get matching business cards
