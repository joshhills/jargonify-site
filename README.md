# Jargonify Site

This is my personal porfolio.

### Feature Creep

- RecommendationPost - dashed outline, used to point to useful external sources.
- Dynamic anecdote post boxes.
- Analytics
- Survey monkey
- Lazy loading of assets (gaussian etc., colour average)
- Properly commented TS
- Properly unit tested TS
- Properly commented SCSS

- Add the 'client experience' to site eventually - like what clients should expect workflow wise
